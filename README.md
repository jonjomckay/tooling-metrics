[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonjomckay/tooling-metrics.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonjomckay/tooling-metrics)

This project contains the components (and a small application) to interact with the ManyWho Metrics API. It allows you 
to view various data points around your usage of the ManyWho Platform.

## Running

The dashboard is based on Facebook's [facebookincubator/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
so it's a doddle to get running.

### Locally

#### Requirements

* Node.js 5+
* npm

The project is a basic Node.js frontend one, and is run using Webpack whilst in development. To get the server up and 
running locally, follow these steps:

1. Install all the dependencies

````bash
$ npm install
````

2. Run the Webpack server

````bash
$ npm start
````

3. A browser window should now open with the simple dashboard
